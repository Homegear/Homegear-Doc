Supported Devices

Homegear supports all newer Z-Wave devices. There might be some old devices that are not supported because of the obsoleted or undocumented classes.

We tested the Z-Wave module with various usb sticks (including a 'bridge' one) and for raspberry pi, even gpio devices, but we cannot be certain it works with all of them. If you find one that does not work, please contact us.

The Z-Wave module supports the Z-Wave devices in a generic way. We tested the Z-Wave module with many devices from many manufacturers, but there still can be devices out there that do not work, or work only partially (especially some older ones). If you find one, please contact us.
