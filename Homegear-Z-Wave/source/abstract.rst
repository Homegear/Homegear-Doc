Z-Wave is an wireless technology and protocol used by hundreds of devices of multiple companies. A lot of devices are battery-powered. Homegear features:


* Protocol support, except some obsoleted command classes
* Security support, for both S0 and S2
* Devices are queried for supported command classes and versions, most of them being exposed
* High reliability by adding resends when no response packet was received
* Builtin support for the most important devices. See :ref:`supported-devices` for more information.
